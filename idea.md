🍴🚌 Food Review & Shuttle Tracker for NST Students
👤 Author

Name: Aditya Singh

Roll Number: 2024-B-22072006E

❓ Problem Statement

At NST hostels, food reviews and complaints often do not reach the staff directly due to intermediaries. This results in unresolved issues.

On the other hand, buses are frequently delayed or overcrowded, causing students to reach late for classes. Currently, there is no reliable system to verify delays or track bus schedules, leading to confusion and excuses.

💡 Proposed Solution

A mobile application that bridges communication gaps and improves punctuality:

🍽️ Mess Features

Get notified about daily meals (breakfast, lunch, snacks, dinner).

View the weekly mess menu in advance.

Submit direct feedback after each meal (reaching staff instantly).

🚌 Shuttle Features

Access bus timings & availability in real time.

See which driver is on shift and get their contact info.

Track the bus location on a map (live GPS integration planned).

📈 Expected Outcome

✔️ Students & staff communicate directly without a mediator.
