Aditya Singh 2024-B-22072006E
Problem: As their is always an issue with in the hostel and reviews never reach properly theirs always a mediator so I want so that students can relay reviews and concerns indiviually to the staff and also theirs always problem bus being not on time or overcroweded which to students reaching late to their classes so fix this and so that no will give excuse of bus being late and if it is their a way to verify it.
Solution: My idea is to make an app for hostel mess where you will be notified about what is for dinner,lunch,breakfast,snacks and you can also view the menu for the week and also leave feedback after each meal, and I also plan to try implement a system such everybody can keep track of bus timings and if bus not available which driver shift is right now and whomto call and also somehow try to integrate a way to track the bus path.
Features:
Weekly View Menu
Provide Feedback
Notified About Meal Timely
Check Bus Timings
Track Bus Location 
Contacts To Driver and The Person In Charge
Target Audience: (Currently NST(Pune) Students and Staff)
Tech-Stack: React-Native,(and external modules as per needed will be notified here after completion of First Release)
Expected Outcome: Become a staple for mess and food related issues to leave concerns and see improvement in the provided concerns. Students Keeping a better track of time with Bus timings given to them via app so they are not late for class.
