Project Title: Food Review & Shuttel Tracker For NST students
Aditya Singh 2024-B-22072006E
Problem: As their is always an issue with in the hostel and reviews never reach properly theirs always a mediator so I want so that students can relay reviews and concerns indiviually to the staff and also theirs always problem bus being not on time or overcroweded which to students reaching late to their classes so fix this and so that no will give excuse of bus being late and if it is their a way to verify it.
Solution: My idea is to make an app for hostel mess where you will be notified about what is for dinner,lunch,breakfast,snacks and you can also view the menu for the week and also leave feedback after each meal, and I also plan to try implement a system such everybody can keep track of bus timings and if bus not available which driver shift is right now and whomto call and also somehow try to integrate a way to track the bus path.
Features:
Weekly View Menu
Provide Feedback
Notified About Meal Timely
Check Bus Timings
Track Bus Location 
Contacts To Driver and The Person In Charge
Target Audience: (Currently NST(Pune) Students and Staff)
Tech-Stack: React-Native,(and external modules as per needed will be notified here after completion of First Release)
Expected Outcome: Become a staple for mess and food related issues to leave concerns and see improvement in the provided concerns. Students Keeping a better track of time with Bus timings given to them via app so they are not late for class.
Week 1–2: Research on the Topic and Find necessary Tech and Data and also make a base of what to build upon
Week 3–4: Do some tests for Backend & DataBase
Week 5–6: Try to finish most of the project by this week
Week 7: Testing & deployment


Project Idea Submission Template
1. Project Title (One-line title for your project) Example: Smart Attendance System using Face Recognition

2. Your Name & Roll Number Example: Aditya Kumar – 21CS101

3. Problem Statement (What problem are you solving? Why does this project need to exist?) Example: "Manual attendance processes are time-consuming and prone to errors. This project aims to automate attendance using facial recognition technology, reducing manual work and ensuring accuracy."

4. Proposed Solution / Idea (How will your project solve the problem? What is the core concept?) Example: "A mobile and web application that uses a camera to recognize student faces, mark attendance, and store records in a secure database. It will also allow teachers to review and export attendance reports."

5. Key Features (List 4–6 main features you plan to implement) Example:

Face detection and recognition
Automated attendance marking
Real-time synchronization with the database
Admin dashboard for reports
Secure authentication system
6. Target Users / Audience (Who will use this project?) Example: "Schools, colleges, and training centers."

7. Technology Stack (Mention tools, frameworks, and languages you plan to use) Example:

AI/ML: OpenCV, Face Recognition Library
8. Expected Outcome (What will the final output look like?) Example: "A functional system that can mark attendance in under 3 seconds per student with 90%+ accuracy."

9. Timeline (Optional) (Rough plan for completion – weeks/months) Example:

Week 1–2: Research & UI design
Week 3–4: Backend setup & database integration
Week 5–6: AI/ML model integration
Week 7: Testing & deploymen
