## ❓ Problem Statement  

> Mess reviews and complaints often do not reach staff directly due to intermediaries, leaving student concerns unresolved.  
>  
> Additionally, buses are frequently delayed or overcrowded, causing students to reach classes late.  
>  
> Currently, there is no reliable way to verify bus delays or track shuttle schedules, leading to excuses and confusion.

## 💡 Proposed Solution  

A **React Native mobile application** to solve two main issues:  

### 🍽️ Hostel Mess  
- Notifications for **breakfast, lunch, snacks, dinner**.  
- **Weekly mess menu** view.  
- Direct **feedback system** to staff (no mediator).  

### 🚌 Shuttle System  
- Real-time **bus timings & availability**.  
- Display **which driver is on shift** with contact details.  
- (Planned) **Live bus tracking** using GPS.
